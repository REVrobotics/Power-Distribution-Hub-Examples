# Get Current and Voltage

## Description

This example shows how to get the channel currents, total current, and input voltage of the PDH.

## Usage

Things to check:

* The team number in the project target matches your roboRIO's team number.

Steps:

1. Deploy the code to your roboRIO with the PDH connected.
2. Open _Periodic Tasks.vi_, you should see the currents and voltages displayed on the front panel.
